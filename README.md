Solar System
==============

A model of the solar system made using html5/webGL. Mainly made as an experiment, to play around with WebGL and its shaders. In the future, once the graphics are sorted, 
I would like to add realistic physics to the simulation.

Current Status
==============

Renders a sphere by tessellating a diamond to a defined depth.
