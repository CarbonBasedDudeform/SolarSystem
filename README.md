Solar System
==============

A model of the solar system made using html5/webGL. Mainly made as an experiment to play with WebGL its shaders. In the future, once the graphics are sorted, 
I would like to add realistic physics to the simulation.

Current Status
==============

Simply renders a triangle at the moment, may switch to using Three.js when I get around to working on this again.

==============

The keyboard can currently be used to move the "planet" that is rendered.

'W' - Move Up

'S' - Move Down
