Solar System
==============

A model of the solar system made using html5/webGL. Mainly made as an experiment, to play around with WebGL and its shaders. In the future, once the graphics are sorted, 
I would like to add realistic physics to the simulation.

Current Status
==============

Renders the sun with the planets orbiting around it. The planets are roughly to scale in terms of size, orbits and distance from each other. Each planet is coloured a general colour using shaders at the moment that reflects its overall colour (eg. blue for earth, red-brown for mars).

Controls
==============

The keyboard can currently be used to move the camera around focused on the sun at the centre.

'W' - Zoom In

'A' - Zoom Out

'S' - Speed up Time

'D' - Slow down Time


'P' - Rotate solar system clockwise along X-axis

';' - Rotate solar system anticlockwise along X-axis
